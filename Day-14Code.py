# Day 14 - Lambda & Recursion
# Topic: Recursive Factorial + Lambda Sorting by GPA

# Recursive function to calculates n factorial
# if n is 0 or 1 then it returns 1 due to factorial of them is 1.
# else it calls itself recursively n - 1 times and multiplying factorial of n - 1 with n and continues till n is 0 or 1. 
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:

# Lambda function to sort a list of dictionaries based on GPA
# This uses sorted() to sort elements, the lambda function, lambda x: x['GPA'] extracts GPA from each dictionary. reverse = true displays GPA's in  descending order.

    return sorted(students, key=lambda x: x['GPA'], reverse = True)
